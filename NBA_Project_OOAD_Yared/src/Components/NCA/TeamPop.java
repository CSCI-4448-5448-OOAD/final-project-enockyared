/*Class GenerateTeam

    Declare a HashSet named 'nameSet' for storing generated names
    Declare 'playerGenerator' for generating players
    Declare a constant 'ROSTER_SIZE' with value 9

    Constructor:
        Initialize 'nameSet' as a new HashSet
        Initialize 'playerGenerator' as a new GeneratePlayer

    Method generateName:
        Initialize a string 'name' as empty
        Set 'listLength' as 4
        While 'name' is empty:
            Generate a random integer 'random'
            Assign 'TeamList.teamNameList[random]' to 'name'
            If 'nameSet' contains 'name', set 'name' to empty
        Add 'name' to 'nameSet'
        Return 'name'


    Method generatePositionList:
        Create a list 'positions' with all player positions
        Return 'positions' as an ArrayList

    Method generateBenchPlayer (takes Position and Role):
        Return result of 'playerGenerator.createPlayer' with given position and role

    Method generateBench (takes Team):
        Initialize 'positionList' using 'generatePositionList'
        For each player in bench (ROSTER_SIZE - 5):
            Remove and get a random position from 'positionList'
            If first bench player, assign Role as 'Sixth_man'
            Else, assign Role as 'Bench'
            Add generated player to the team
        Return modified team

    Method generateGodTeam:
        Create a new Team with generated name, and TeamType 'God_team'
        Initialize 'positionList' using 'generatePositionList'
        For each of the 5 starting players:
            Remove and get a random position from 'positionList'
            Create a player with Role 'Superstar' and Type 'God'
            Add player to team
        Return team with bench players added

    Method generateSuperTeam:
        Similar to 'generateGodTeam', but with different Role and Type assignments

    Method generateContendingTeam:
        Similar to 'generateSuperTeam', but with a varying number of superstars

    Method generatePlayoffTeam:
        Similar to 'generateContendingTeam', but with stars instead of superstars

    Method generateAverageTeam:
        Similar to 'generatePlayoffTeam', but with only starters

    Method generateRandomTeamType:
        Generate a random integer
        Determine TeamType based on random value ranges

    Method generateTeam (takes TeamType):
        Switch on 'teamType':
            Case 'God_team': return result of 'generateGodTeam'
            Case 'Super_team': return result of 'generateSuperTeam'
            ... (other cases for different team types)
            Default: throw IllegalArgumentException

    Method createTeam (no parameters):
        Return result of 'generateTeam' with a random TeamType

    Method createTeam (takes TeamType):
        Return result of 'generateTeam' with given TeamType
